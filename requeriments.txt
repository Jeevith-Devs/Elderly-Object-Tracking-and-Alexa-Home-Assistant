Project Requirements

1. Hardware Requirements

ESP32 / ESP8266 – 1 unit – Microcontroller to read sensors and send data to cloud.
IR Sensors – 4 units – Detect objects entering four corner zones.
USB Cable – 1 – Power and upload code to ESP32.
Breadboard & Jumper Wires – As required – For circuit connections during prototyping.
Power Supply / Adapter – 1 – To provide stable 5V or 3.3V to ESP32.
Optional: LEDs – 4 – Indicate detection visually for testing.
Objects (keys, wallet, medicine box, books, etc.) – 3–5 – Test objects for tracking demonstration.

2. Software Requirements

a. Development Platforms / Tools
Arduino IDE – Write and upload ESP32/ESP8266 code.
Node.js + Express – Cloud backend to store object locations.
Firebase / MongoDB (Optional) – Database for persistent storage.
AWS Lambda – Host Alexa skill backend logic.
Alexa Developer Console – Create and configure custom Alexa skill.
Web Browser – Access backend APIs and test endpoints.
HTTP Client / Postman – Test backend endpoints (optional).

b. Software Modules
Microcontroller Module – Reads IR sensor inputs, detects objects, and sends data to the cloud backend.
Cloud Backend Module – Receives data from ESP32, stores object location, and exposes API for Alexa queries.
Database Module (Optional) – Stores historical object locations and timestamps.
Alexa Skill Module – Handles voice commands, queries cloud backend, and responds with last-seen object zones.
User Interface Module (Optional) – Mobile app or web interface for visual representation of objects in the room.

3. Network Requirements
Stable Wi-Fi – ESP32 connects to cloud backend.
Internet access – Required for Alexa skill to query cloud backend.

4. Other Requirements
Room setup – Four corners must be accessible for sensor placement.
Detection space – Objects must pass within IR sensor range.
Minimal obstructions – Avoid blocking sensors with furniture.
Testing objects – Small objects to verify detection system.
